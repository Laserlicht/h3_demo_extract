# h3_demo_extract
Heroes III: Might of Magic Demo extraction

Can extract the two demos from MAC (complete) and Win (RoE) and sum up the resources.

The Win version has some missing Creature sprites and other resources not contained in MAC version. The win version contains more audio (mp3) than the MAC version.

Audio/Video extraction currently not supported.

## Functionality
Runs currently only on Linux.

unar and unshield has to be installed:
`sudo apt install unar unshield`

After that just run the Jupyter Notebook (for example in VS Code).
